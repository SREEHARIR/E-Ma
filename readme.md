# E-ma

AN IOT Device which can monitor the health of a baby and also attempts to recreate the environment as felt by the baby in the womb mainly the heartbeat sound of the mother. This has been proven to have calming effects on newborn babies. The health of the baby is monitored and updated onto the cloud network which can only be accessed by the mother and the doctor under authorised conditions.

#### TO-DO
* Use Realtime data of mothers Heartbeat instead of Recorded audio - _Will need to create seperate Mother Device and Child Device_
* Encrypt traffic between Device and Cloud
* Provide different authentication for doctor and Mother(Authorised user)
